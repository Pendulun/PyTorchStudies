# PyTorchStudies
This is where I keep my studies for Deep Learning with PyTorch

## PyTorchFreeCodeCampYoutube (DONE)

This folder represents what I studied by following a 25 hour YouTube course from Daniel Bourke on FreeCodeCamp's channel called [PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA). It covered the Fundamentals, PyTorch Workflow, Neural Network Classification, Computer Vision, Custom Datasets and also provides it's own [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning).

I also intend to take the Daniel Bourke's broader course on Udemy on this topic ([PyTorch for Deep Learning in 2023: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning/)) that also covers Transfer Learning, Experiment Tracking, Paper Replication and Model Deployment.
